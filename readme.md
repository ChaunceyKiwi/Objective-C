## ObjectExample

* This project includes some simple examples that use *object-oriented programming* features of Objective-C, such as class, object, function, inherit, polymorphism and etc.

* In order to learn it fast, I add some annotation inside these examples temporarily.

## Specifications

* There are three classes: `people`, `student` and `employee`; where `student` and `employee` inherited from class `people`.

* At here, we add some polymorphism features inside these child classes. You can check the result from the terminal outputs.
